# ZMK Config

## Installing firmware

Installing firmware on the nice!nano is easy.

1. Plug in your nice!nano to your computer.
2. Enter the bootloader by double-tapping the reset button.
3. Drag and drop the `.uf2` file onto the `NICENANO` drive or copy it with your terminal.
4. After flashing is complete, the drive will disappear and the nice!nano will reboot.
5. If you haven't yet, you can turn the power switch **on** by pushing it up on the side of the keyboard.
